# about

this is the furthest-down entry. It's what will build the index.html.
(for context in case you're reading this after it's compiled, i'm writing in <code>000_about.md</code>)
and no matter what it's called, if it fits 000_[anything].md, it'll be built into index.html
so this is where you can put your readme, or information about the site, or whatever else
i set it up with three 0's to count in hex... who knows how long i'll keep that up, i might change that around
